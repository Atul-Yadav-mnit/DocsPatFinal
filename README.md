# DocsPatFinal
This is a new git repository containing both docspat frontend and server. It is just a new repository combined of two seperate previous git repositories on this account with some minor changes.

How does DocsPat came in existance?? 
Let me share one incident with you, I with my father was waiting in a small ENT clinic. It was the time when covid second wave was taking its peak. We had to wait for 2 hours till our turn in a small clinic where social distancing was next to impossible.I had a chitchat with doctor but was not able to talk more as paients were waiting. I came to know from the counter person that most of these reside far away from city as rewari has widespread villages but everyone has to come to main city for their needs and these people prefer to wait for hours rather than just having a round trip again. So i decided to develop something for them as the problem was that the process of getting appointment was totally offline,

I had learned making web apps using MERN stack. Thats how docspat started came in its existance.

Here is the detailed lookout of Docspat.

It is basically an OPD appointment booking app. User can register and then book appointments of their nearby doctors as per slot availability. User can also access their history of appointments and use them as a reference for further consultations.

Doctors can too login as a doctor to see their patients list and prescribe them via web-app only making the whole process digital.

The application is built on the MERN STACK of technologies and using RESTful web services architecture and used redux for application state management.

Wondering How it all works??

For patients :-
It all starts with registering yourself as a patient on the web app.Lookout you nearby doctors from various departments.
In order to make appointment make appropiate choice of department and doctor and we will fetch available slots for the next day to you. Simply choose the slot you want as per availibilty. Hurray! its done, thats it. Just move ahead to my appointments button and check for your current appointment details as well as past history of appontments.

For doctors :- 
Firstly you need to contact us to register yourself. We will verify your details and register you on our platform. After that just simply login in the web app and dive into my patients section to look out for todays booking. Also prescribe the patient straight away from the app.
