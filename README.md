# DocsPatFinal
This is a new git repository containing both docspat frontend and server. It is just a new repository combined of two seperate previous git repositories on this account with some minor changes.

Why does DocsPat exists?? Let me share one incident with you, I with my father was waiting in a small ENT clinic. It was the time when covid second wave was taking its peak. We had to wait for 2 hours till our turn in a small clinic where social distancing was next to impossible.I had a chitchat with doctor but was not able to talk more as paients were waiting. I came to know from the counter person that most of these reside far away from city as rewari has widespread villages but everyone has to come to main city for their needs and these people prefer to wait for hours rather than just having a round trip again. So i decided to develop something for them as the problem was that the process of getting appointment was totally offline,

I had learned making web apps using MERN stack. Thats how docspat started came in its existance.

Here is the detailed lookout of Docspat.

It is basically an OPD appointment booking app. User can register and then book appointments of their nearby doctors as per slot availability. User can also access their history of appointments and use them as a reference for further consultations.

Doctors can too login as a doctor to see their patients list and prescribe them via web-app only making the whole process digital.

The application is built on the MERN STACK of technologies and using RESTful web services architecture and used redux for application state management.
